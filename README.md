# Deepship-dataset-segmentation-method
Deepship dataset segmentation method and marine environment background noise dataset

The repository of this container is to provide the segmentation method of the data set used in our paper, and to provide the marine environment background noise data set used by us, so that you can reproduce our work.
(1) Download DeepShip datasets;
(2) Run the above code;
(3) The marine environment background noise used in our paper can be downloaded through the baidu online disk link:
