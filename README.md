# Deepship dataset segmentation method
This repository presents the Deepship dataset segmentation method employed in our paper [Underwater acoustic target recognition based on spectrum component analysis of ship radiated noise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X2300350X) and offers the marine environment background noise dataset utilized in the study.

### The repository is to provide the segmentation method of the data set used in our [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X2300350X), and to provide the marine environment background noise data set used by us, so that you can reproduce our work.  
(1) Download DeepShip datasets;  
(2) Run the above code;  
(3) The marine environment background noise used in our paper can be downloaded through the baidu online disk link:
